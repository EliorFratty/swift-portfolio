# Find my flower
Flower finding app that I sold it as a final project in an app building course. 
The app is for people who like to travel outside and see beautiful flowers and fail to recognize what this type of flower is. 
With the app you can take pictures of the flower and find out what it is and also get information from Wikipedia. You can also get a photo of an author
flower and identify the flower.

I'm extremely pleased with how the project came out. 
Find my flower was built with Xcode and written entirely in Swift 5; it utilizes Auto Layout for
UI design, and makes extensive use of CoreML, CoreData and JSON response parsing.
