# Find my flower
Flower finding app that I sold it as a final project in an app building course. 
The app is for people who like to travel outside and see beautiful flowers and fail to recognize what this type of flower is. 
With the app you can take pictures of the flower and find out what it is and also get information from Wikipedia. You can also get a photo of an author
flower and identify the flower.

I'm extremely pleased with how the project came out. 
Find my flower was built with Xcode and written entirely in Swift 5; it utilizes Auto Layout for
UI design, and makes extensive use of CoreML, CoreData and JSON response parsing.

# ShowOff
ShowOff is a take-home project I recently completed as part of the interview process for an iOS Developer role. The
basic requirements for the app were that it display ten currently showing movies, using data
from androidhive.org's REST api, Including take snap of QR code and obtaining information from it.
Choice of design and UI elements were left open to the developer.

I'm quite happy with the final product: ShowOff was built entirely in Swift, with no external dependencies, and the
UI—which was created using Auto Layout in Interface Builder—is attractive and animates smoothly. Most importantly, the
code is clean, easy to reason about, and maintains strong separation of concerns.
