# Find my flower
Flower finding app that I sold as a final project in an app building course. 
The app is for people who like to travel outside and see beautiful flowers and fail to recognize what this type of flower is. 
With the app you can take pictures of the flower and find out what it is and also get information from Wikipedia. You can also get a photo of an author flower and identify the flower.

I'm extremely pleased with how the project came out. 
Find my flower was built with Xcode and written entirely in Swift 5; it utilizes Auto Layout for
UI design, and makes extensive use of CoreML, CoreData and JSON response parsing.

# Soccer Stats
Soccer Stats is a social app that came up with my soccer team friends. The main goal is to connect people who like to play soccer in the neighborhood and who do not find who to play with. The second goal is to save results, rate players, confirm arrivals, payments, etc.
This is the current project I am working on and is constantly improving.

The project is underway with a thorough study of SWIFT language and wide use of all the possibilities it offers.
FireBase, Animation, CNContact, Whats'up Api, CoreLocation and more...

# ShowOff
ShowOff is a take-home project I recently completed as part of the interview process for an iOS Developer role. The
basic requirements for the app were that it display ten currently showing movies, using data
from androidhive.org's REST api, Including take snap of QR code and obtaining information from it.
Choice of design and UI elements were left open to the developer.

I'm quite happy with the final product: ShowOff was built entirely in Swift, with no external dependencies, and the UI—which was created using Auto Layout in Interface Builder—is attractive and animates smoothly. Fire-base as Most importantly, the code is clean, easy to reason about, and maintains strong separation of concerns.
